🧠 Algo Visualizer

An interactive algorithm visualization web app that helps students and developers understand how popular algorithms work — visually and intuitively.
It covers a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms, including Arrays, Sorting, Graphs, Queues, Recursion, and more.

F⚙️ Features

✅ Visualizes sorting, searching, graph traversal, number theory, and more
✅ Interactive buttons and animations for each algorithm
✅ Time and space complexity charts
✅ Modular structure — each algorithm has its own HTML file
✅ Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
✅ Beginner-friendly, educational design
